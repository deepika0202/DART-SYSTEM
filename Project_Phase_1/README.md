## Assumptions

1. We have assumed that employees do not take any holidays from work. Therefore all employees do work each day.
2. Promotional discounts on travel cards are offered only for a particular day and not for an entire week or month. Therefore if promotions are offered for three simultaneous dates, there will be three entities in the promotional entity type. 
3. Each guest belongs to only one A-star passenger. Two or more A-star passengers cannot have the same guest. 
4. A ticket is valid for the entire day and the passenger can use the ticket for travel at any time of the day. 
5. All A-Star passengers are A-class passengers
6. All bus stops have unique bus stop numbers which can be used to identify them.
7. Buses parked in the terminal can be parked for specific durations of time.
